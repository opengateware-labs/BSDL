2. OVERVIEW


These are the IEEE Std 1149.1 Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
files generated by Xilinx. These BSDL files are boundary-scan models for 
unconfigured Zynq-7000 SoCs.  Refer to the Vivado write_bsdl tool or the
ISE BSDLAnno tool to generate BSDL files for a specific configuration.

The Zynq-7000 device contains two TAPs in series: the ARM DAP and the PL
TAP. See the JTAG and DAP Subsystem chapter in UG585. The Zynq BSDL file
represents the PL TAP and the device boundary-register.  The ARM DAP
(zynq7000_arm_dap.bsd) must be inserted before the Zynq device in the
JTAG scan chain to correctly model the JTAG chain.

For more information on BSDL files, see:

What is BSDL, and how do I read a BSDL file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/8350.htm

What is BSDLAnno? How do I use it to create a post-configuration BSDL
file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/15346.htm




3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

These files may be used on any computer platform. They are text files. 

Software:
  -- Vivado Design Suite (recommended)
  -- ISE Design Suite (note: some devices are not supported in ISE)


4. DESIGN FILES

See FileMap.txt for a list of supported devices and their associated BSDL 
file names.  This is the file from the Vivado BSDL directory that describes 
how each BSDL file aligns to a specific part.

zynq7000_arm_dap.bsd is the BSDL file for the ARM processor DAP.


5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Installation and use of these files is dependent on the type of system
you are using and the purpose for using these files. 

Back up the original files before copying files from the Xilinx
Download Center to the installation directory.  The BSDL files used 
by the Vivado Design Suite are located in the directory
Vivado/<version>/data/parts/xilinx/zynq/public/bsdl/

The BSDL files used by the ISE Design Suite are located in the directory
ISE_DS/ISE/zynq/data.

For use with boundary-scan test tools, follow these instructions:
 
A.	Use these files with your boundary-scan test tool to generate 
        boundary-scan tests on unconfigured SoCs, or use the write_bsdl
        or BSDLAnno tool to generate a BSDL file for boundary-scan test
        on a specific SoC configuration.
B.	Review the design warnings in the BSDL file for special test 
        procedures.


6. SUPPORT

To obtain technical support for these BSDL files, go to 
www.xilinx.com/support to locate answers to known issues in the Xilinx
Answers Database.  Enter text 'bsdl' in the text search box at the top
of the page. For additional support options, see the Additional
Resources on the Support page.
