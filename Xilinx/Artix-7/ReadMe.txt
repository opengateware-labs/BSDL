2. OVERVIEW


These are the IEEE Std 1149.1 Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
files generated by Xilinx. These BSDL files are boundary-scan models for 
unconfigured FPGAs. Refer to the Vivado write_bsdl tool or the ISE
BSDLAnno tool to generate BSDL files for a specific FPGA configuration.

For more information on BSDL files, see:

What is BSDL, and how do I read a BSDL file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/8350.htm

What is BSDLAnno? How do I use it to create a post-configuration BSDL
file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/15346.htm




3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

These files may be used on any computer platform. They are text files. 

Software:
  -- Vivado Design Suite
  -- ISE Design Suite


4. DESIGN FILES

See FileMap.txt for a list of supported devices and their associated BSDL 
file names.


5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Installation and use of these files is dependent on the type of system
you are using and the purpose for using these files. 

Back up the original files before copying files from the Xilinx Download 
Center to the installation directory.  The BSDL files used by the Vivado 
Design Suite are located in the directory
Vivado/<version>/data/parts/xilinx/artix7/public/bsdl

The BSDL files used by the ISE Design Suite are located in the directory
ISE_DS/ISE/artix7/data.  Note that ISE does not support the XC7A12T,
XC7A15T, or XC7A25T.

For use with boundary-scan test tools, follow these instructions:
 
A.	Use these files with your boundary-scan test tool to generate 
        boundary-scan tests on unconfigured FPGAs, or use the write_bsdl
        or BSDLAnno tool to generate a BSDL file for boundary-scan test
        on a specific FPGA configuration.
B.	Review the design warnings in the BSDL file for special test 
        procedures.


6. SUPPORT

To obtain technical support for these BSDL files, go to 
www.xilinx.com/support to locate answers to known issues in the Xilinx
Answers Database.  Enter text 'bsdl' in the text search box at the top
of the page. For additional support options, see the Additional
Resources on the Support page.
